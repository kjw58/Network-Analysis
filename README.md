# Ciudad Bolívar Resilience Network Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook with sample code for exploratory data analysis combining multiple datasets for my PhD research on **infrastructure and community and climate resilience** in *Ciudad Bolívar*, an informal settlement in Bogotá, Colombia. 
The project integrates **community-generated participatory data**, open urban datasets, and **advanced multilayer spatial network** and **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** methods. It aims to support equitable, community-informed urban planning and resilient infrastructure investment in informal settlements.

## Key Techniques & Tools
- **Python**, **NetworkX**, **PyTorch Geometric**
- **Multilayer spatial networks**, **Social-Ecological-Technological (SETs)** framework
- **GNN-based resilience prediction**
- **Community data integration**, participatory mapping, art-based methods
